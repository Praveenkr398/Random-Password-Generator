## **Random Password Generator | Features & Functionality**

### **Project Overview**
The **Random Password Generator** is a web-based tool designed to create strong and secure passwords instantly. Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this tool ensures better password security with an automatic mix of numbers, symbols, and characters. Additionally, it comes with **voice synthesis**, which reads out the generated password, and a **copy-to-clipboard** feature for convenience.

### **Features:**
1. **Automatic Password Generation** â€“ Creates a completely random password using a **mix of numbers, symbols, and characters**.
2. **Fixed Character Type Inclusion** â€“ The user cannot manually choose symbols, numbers, or letters; the generator ensures a balanced mix for stronger security.
3. **Customizable Password Length** â€“ Users can define the password length (minimum 8 characters).
4. **Voice Synthesis Feature** â€“ Each generated password is **read aloud** using the Web Speech API.
5. **Copy to Clipboard** â€“ One-click feature to **copy the generated password** to easily use it elsewhere.
6. **Responsive UI** â€“ A clean and user-friendly interface that works well on different screen sizes.

### **How It Works**
1. The user selects the **desired length** of the password.
2. The generator **automatically creates** a strong password with random characters.
3. The generated password is displayed in a text field.
4. The **voice synthesis** reads the password out loud.
5. The user can **copy the password** with a single click.

### **Technology Stack**
- **HTML** â€“ Structure and layout.
- **CSS** â€“ Styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript** â€“ Logic for generating random passwords, voice synthesis, and copy-to-clipboard functionality.
